# Hangman



### The assignment
In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Hangman or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML powered by your JavaScript code.


## Option Two: Hangman Game (Moderate - Recommended)


1. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

3. Display the following on the page:

  * Press any key to get started!

  * Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

    * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

    * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

  * Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

  * Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

4. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

##### Hangman Game Bonuses

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.

###The Solution

I created a Hangman game based around the theme of Animals. The game gives you five wrong guesses before you lose. A 'success' sound plays when you win the game. A 'failure' sound plays when you lose.

The design is imgae-based with a different background image of an animal loading each time.
